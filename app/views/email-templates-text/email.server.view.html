 # This email is optimized for mobile email clients, and even
 #      works relatively well in the Android Gmail App, which does
 #      not support Media Queries, but does have limited mobile-
 #      friendly functionality.
 #
 # While this coding method is very flexible, it can be more
 #      brittle than traditionally-coded emails, particularly in
 #      Microsoft Outlook 2007-2010. Outlook-specific conditional
 #      CSS is included to counteract the inconsistencies that
 #      crop up.
