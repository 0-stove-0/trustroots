## Volunteering

You don't have the be a programmer to participate. Check [volunteers page](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/wiki/Volunteering) for more info.

## Development

## Installing

We have two major ways of running the software: trough Docker (easier to get started with) or by installing locally.

### Installing locally

Install the stack on your localhost and run NodeJS. This approach takes a little more time to setup, and bit more manual configuration, but is super fast, and can be easier to work with. See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for details.

### Installing with Docker

The easiest and quickest way to get started is with Docker. See [INSTALL-DOCKER.md](INSTALL-DOCKER.md) for further details. Running through Docker can be a little bit slower.
