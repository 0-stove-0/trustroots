## Development

Check [developers.trustroots.org](http://developers.trustroots.org/) to get started.


## Installing

We have two major ways of running the software:
* Using Docker containers — easier and quick to get started with. See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)
* Installing locally — runs faster, but more initial work. See [INSTALL-DOCKER.md](INSTALL-DOCKER.md)


### Installing locally

Install the stack on your localhost and run NodeJS. This approach takes a little more time to setup, and bit more manual configuration, but is super fast, and can be easier to work with. See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for details.


### Installing with Docker

The easiest and quickest way to get started is with Docker. See [INSTALL-DOCKER.md](INSTALL-DOCKER.md) for further details. Running through Docker can be a little bit slower.
