# Translating Trustroots (localization)

Thank you for your interest in translating Trustroots! :tada:

You'll learn how to start translating here.

## Tools

There are a few tools available which you can use:

- [Poedit](https://poedit.net/) is a free and open-source translation tool. You can [install it](https://poedit.net/download) on Windows, Mac and Unix. It supports gettext (.po) format.
- [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/) is an online translation platform. It is free for [Open Source projects](https://docs.transifex.com/projects/open-source-project). Trustroots currently doesn't have an account. It supports [gettext](https://docs.transifex.com/formats/gettext) (.po) format.
- [Locize](https://locize.com/) is a paid translation platform for i18next format. We don't have an account and probably don't need it.
- A text editor of your preference (not preferred)
- _Share your favourite tool!_

## How to start

Tell us which language you'd like to translate to and we'll make sure the translation files are available and up-to-date. You can also [see the translation files and locales](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/tree/master/public/locales).

_If you know how to use [git](https://git-scm.com/), clone this repository and go to [./public/locales](https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/tree/master/public/locales). Otherwise we'll provide the translation files to you._

## Translate

Open the `.po` files with [Poedit](https://poedit.net/) and enjoy the translating. Save your work.

Alternatively, you can edit the `.json` files with your text editor.

## Share

Send us your work and we'll publish it in your name.

Alternatively, if you know how to use [git](https://git-scm.com/), create a pull request with your work. We'll review and merge it as soon as possible.

## Stay tuned

There will be new translations coming. We'd love if you stay with us and help!
