        <h3>Analytics</h3>

        Right now Trustroots uses <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> to collect usage statistics. We're looking into switching to an open source alternative <a href="http://piwik.org/" target="_blank">Piwik</a> with the help from <a href="https://indiehosters.net/" target="_blank">IndieHosters</a>.

        <br><br>

        To opt-out of all tracking (including Google Analytics and Piwik), you could install Google's official <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">opt out extension</a> or use <a href="https://www.ghostery.com/" target="_blank">Ghostery</a>, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/noscript/" target="_blank">Noscript</a> or <a href="https://disconnect.me/" target="_blank">Disconnect</a>. These browser extensions will disable all the known JavaScript trackers and ensure that your browser does not send a request to external tracking servers.

        If you wish to stay completely anonymous online, please see the PDF guide by Piwik <a href="http://piwik.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/How-to-remain-anonymous-online.pdf" target="_blank">How to remain anonymous online?</a>


        <h3>Social networks</h3>

        Some of the features at the site use other social networks such as Twitter or Facebook. You don't have to connect your profile to these and we don't share any info with these sites. We only crawl info you give us access to and show it at your profile if you want to.
