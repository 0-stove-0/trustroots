        <h3>Your data is yours</h3>

        Soon enough you will be able to download your profile data.

        <br><br>

        Also soon you will be able to remove your profile completelly from the system. Currently you can ask us to do so and the feature itself is in development.

        <br><br>

        We will never ever sell your profile data to anyone or try to otherwise use it commercially.


        <h3>Analytics & opting out</h3>

        Right now Trustroots uses <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> to collect usage statistics and <a href="http://www.newrelic.com">New Relic</a> to monitor performance. We're looking into switching to an open source alternative <a href="http://piwik.org/">Piwik</a>, but running Piwik isn't that straightforward. We hope you understand and let us know if you could help us with that!

        <br><br>

        To opt-out of Google Analytics tracking, you could install Google's official <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">opt out extension</a>. To opt-out of all tracking (including Google Analytics and Piwik) you can install <a href="https://www.ghostery.com/">Ghostery</a>, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/noscript/">Noscript</a> or <a href="https://disconnect.me/">Disconnect</a>. These browser extensions will disable all known JavaScript trackers and ensure that your browser does not send a request to external tracking servers.

        If you wish to stay completely anonymous online, please check this guide by Piwik: <a href="http://piwik.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/How-to-remain-anonymous-online.pdf">How to remain anonymous online? (PDF)</a>.


        <h3>Social networks</h3>

        Some of the features at the site use other social networks such as Twitter, Facebook or Gravatar. You don't have to connect your profile to these and we don't share any data with these networks. We only crawl info you give us access to and show it at your profile if you want to. Some of the data from these sites is then stored at our server.

        <br><br>

        Some of our users want to use these networks and they have a right to do so. Others prefer to steer away from these networks and we'll also accommodate these users.

        <h3>Your emails</h3>

        We route all our emails using <a href="http://mandrillapp.com">Mandrill</a>. They're reliable, professional and we trust them. They do much better job than we could ever do and privacy wise using their service equals to buying a server space from somewhere else.

        <br><br>

        If you subscribe to our newsletters, your email will be stored at <a href="http://www.mailchimp.com">MailChimp</a> since we use them to send newsletters. MailChimp and Mandrill are the same company, just via Mandrill nothing is stored.


        <h3>Our server</h3>

        Our server (and thus your data) is securely hosted at <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=6dc078966c9c" title="(Referral link)">DigitalOcean</a> and backed up hourly to <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>.
