      <h3 id="is-trustroots-exclusively-for-hitchhikers">Is Trustroots exclusively for hitchhikers?</h3>
      You're welcome to sign up if you've never hitchhiked; we don't exclusively focus on hitchhikers. In the initial phase we're focusing on getting especially hitchhikers on board and making the site ideal for that. Many people who hitchhike have a specific way of traveling that is not always well served by some websites. Hitchhikers are also traveling a lot more than the average Joe, which is a good way to spread the idea further. Our background is within Hitchhikers community and in <a href="http://hitchwiki.org/">Hitchwiki</a>. The site will obviously remain rather alternative and true to its roots, even when we introduce it to new communities.
      <br>
      We want to maintain the feeling of a small community and we have some technical ideas for doing this with the site. We'll soon add functionality that will make it convenient for people who prefer to host people from within their own communities (e.g. vegans, musicians), but it will always be possible to open your home to anyone on the site if you prefer.

      <br><br>

      <h3 id="why-the-name-trustroots">Why the name Trustroots?</h3>
      Back to the roots. Earthy. The art of asking — and trusting — is something we often experience while traveling. We also have some innovative ideas that can help building trust among people. Once the network is big enough we'd love to work with scientists to build something that can really make a difference through trust metrics.

      <br><br>

      <h3 id="what-is-your-legal-status">What's your legal status?</h3>
      Good question. We're looking to set up a non profit in the European Union soon. <a ui-sref="contact">Contact us</a> if you have experience with this and you want to help.

      <br><br>

      <h3 id="are-you-going-to-sell-out">Are you going to sell out?</h3>
      NO! We think it's a shame that former non profits have been sold to venture capital. We have high ideals and we've been running other big freegan projects for years. This is not a startup.

      <br><br>

      <h3 id="is-trustroots-alternative">Is Trustroots an alternative for CouchSurfing or BeWelcome?</h3>
      Trustroots isn't on purpose an alternative to anything specifically. There are many people to whom Facebook, CouchSurfing or other tools aren't suitable for multitude of reasons. We encourage using any tools you wish in parallel. We are trying to make it easy to gather your contents from these sites also to Trustroots.

      <br><br>

      <h3 id="how-do-you-want-to-make-the-project-financially-sustainable">How do you want to make the project financially sustainable?</h3>
      Donations and grants are the most likely ways. There are many inspiring organisations out there serving as great examples: <a href="https://www.warmshowers.org/">Warmshowers Foundation</a>, <a href="http://www.abgefahren-ev.de/">Abgefahren e.V.</a> (Hitchwiki), <a href="http://www.bevolunteer.net/">BeVolunteer</a>, <a href="http://www.servas.org/">Servas</a>, <a href="http://www.wwoof.net/">WWOOF</a> and many more. Again, if you have experience with this it would be great if you <a ui-sref="contact">contact us</a>.

      <br><br>

      <h3 id="who-decides-what-gets-done">Who decides what gets done?</h3>
      Anyone can join us as a <a href="https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/wiki/Volunteering">volunteer</a>. We're huge fans of do-cracy and getting things done attitude. We have <a ui-sref="team">a core team</a> which is formed from the most active volunteers. There isn't voting or other buraucratic processes involved, but you get more responsibility by simply becoming active contributor and showing your communication skills. Great community values simple translation jobs just as much as highly skilled development. We'll aim to keep the entry level for volunteers as low as possible. No bureaucracy. Pragmatic approach. Trust.
      <br>
      That said, any well organized project needs efficient teams working on specific issues (such as <i>safety</i> or site's <i>features/UX</i>). Rather than building complicated voting mechanisms or other structures, we'll try to concentrate in fostering volunteers into responsible, skilled teams. It's also important to make sure everyone has the same goal and vision.

      <br><br>

      <h3 id="why-is-there-no-forum">Why is there no forum?</h3>
      The practical answer: it takes time to set up a forum and even more time to keep it spam-free. The less practical answer: In our long-term and short-term experience forum activity is not necessarily the best way to get to more real life interactions (or in other less nice words: there's a lot of pointless bickering out there). In the long term we do want to provide a way to communicate on the site, but this will probably look more like the quick and easy way you can interact on Facebook or Diaspora than a full fledged forum. There are already plenty of ways to contact us and have discussions among members.

      <br><br>

      <h3 id="why-is-there-facebook-connection">Why is there Facebook connection?</h3>
      So that people who have their data, photos and connections on Facebook can release their information to Trustroots. Using Facebook from Trustroots is optional. <a href="http://ideas.trustroots.org/2014/12/29/life-outside-big-blue-box/">Read our blog post</a> about this.

      <br><br>

      <h3 id="are-you-planning-to-do-x-feature">Are you planning to do X feature?</h3>
      See our <a ui-sref="todo">to-do</a> for major directions and <a href="https://github.com/Trustroots/trustroots/issues">GitHub</a> for the rest. Feel free to <a ui-sref="contact">tell us</a> about your ideas! The current version of Trustroots is the most limited software you can imagine that still works for hospitality. We simply haven't had time to build most of the features yet. Please be patient.

      <br><br>

      <h3 id="decentralize-it">Decentralize it?</h3>
      Yes please! If you can make a working decentralized prototype we'll happily decentralize the whole thing. Decentralization is technically very challenging and is not the team's priority. But we will soon add a quick and easy way to export your profile data, oAuth and document our API.

      <br><br>

      <h3 id="how-is-this-connected-to-hitchwiki-nomadwiki-or-trashwiki">How is this connected to Hitchwiki, Nomadwiki or Trashwiki?</h3>
      The team creating Trustroots also created these projects. We will want to integrate them to some degree into Trustroots since they share pretty much the same vision and user base.

      <br><br>

      <h3 id="what-is-your-long-term-vision">What is your long term vision?</h3>
      <em>"We want a world that encourages trust, adventure and intercultural connections."</em> See <a ui-sref="about">about</a> for more.

      <br><br>

      <h3 id="how-can-i-contact-you">How can can I contact you?</h3>
