<h3>Manifesto</h3>
We want a world that encourages trust and adventure. Our goal is to make people spend more time outside meeting each other instead of their computers.
<br><br>
We believe in beauty, simplicity and transparency. Trust Roots is completely free to use and will remain so forever.
<br><br>
We emphasize community.

<em>Enjoy!</em>
