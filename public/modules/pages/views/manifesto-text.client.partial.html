<h3>Manifesto</h3>
We want a world that encourages trust and adventure. Our goal is to make people spend more time outside meeting each other instead of their computers.

We believe in beauty, simplicity and transparency. Trustroots is completely free to use and will remain so forever.
<br><br>
We emphasize community.

<em>See you!</em>
